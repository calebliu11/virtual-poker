# cse237-project
This project aims to create a fully-playable virtual poker game, where a user can play against the computer in one-on-one no-limit Texas Hold'em.

Iteration 1:
We completed all user stories relating to playing poker against a computer opponent with the options of checking, calling, raising, and folding. We also made it possible to view the cards in the player's hand and the community cards. Moreover, the user can view the value of his or her best five-card hand and face off against the computer's hand, winning or losing money in the process. Running out of money will cause a player to lose the game, and vice versa for the computer.

However, we have not yet implemented the standard blinds of poker. Furthermore, we are not done creating an interactive GUI, so this first iteration is a purely text-based game.
