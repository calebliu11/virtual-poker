# cse237-project
This project aims to create a fully-playable virtual poker game, where a user can play against the computer in one-on-one no-limit Texas Hold'em.

Iteration 1:

What user stories were completed this iteration?

We completed all user stories relating to playing poker against a computer opponent with the options of checking, calling, raising, and folding. We also made it possible to view the cards in the player's hand and the community cards. Moreover, the user can view the value of his or her best five-card hand and face off against the computer's hand, winning or losing money in the process. Running out of money will cause a player to lose the game, and vice versa for the computer.

What user stories do you intend to complete next iteration?

We have not yet implemented the standard blinds of poker. Furthermore, we are not done creating an interactive GUI, so this first iteration is a purely text-based game. We also intend to improve the logic of the game and bolster up the computer's AI to be a more formidable opponent.

Is there anything that you implemented but doesn't currently work?

We are working to eliminate any bugs or logic inconsistencies, but overall the flow of the game is there.
